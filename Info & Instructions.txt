The service has been created based on PHP (v8.2.7) using Laravel framework 10.

- The service calculates the possible land route based on your input Origin and Destination. The output is a list of border crossings to get from Origin to Destination.
- You need to have the Xampp server and an editor of your choice to run the service.

Instructions on how to run the service:
1. Copy the project(landRouteCalculator.7z) from Git to your xampp directory (also unzip it).
2. Open the project with the editor (for example : Visual Studio, PHPStorm).
3. In the editors terminal, route the directory where project is copied.
4. Run command - 'php artisan serve'. This will run the application on PHP development server.
5. Click on the local server address shown in INFO(example - http://127.0.0.1:8000) after running previous command. This will launch your application in the browser(showing the welcome page).
6. Now you can test the service by passing the HTTP request in below format:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/routing/{origin}/{destination}



Running the tests:
1. To run the tests, use the command 'php artisan test' in the editor terminal.
2. There are 5 test cases added to test the functionality of the service.
- Test a single country between Origin and Destination
- Test multiple countries between Origin and Destination
- Test same Origin and Destination route
- Test border sharing Origin and Destination (Adjacent countries)
- Test Origin and Destination with no land connection
